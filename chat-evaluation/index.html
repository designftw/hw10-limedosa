  <section>
    <h1>Overview:</h1>
    <p>There are many aspects of heuristic design that are missing from the original chat app. These such failures
      include but are not limited to:
    <ul>

      <li>
        <h3>Match between system and the real world</h3>
        <p>The chat app uses a lot of jargon that is not common in most texting apps. A lot of the initial wording such
          as "channels" make it difficult to navigate since users are only given a text box and don't know what to type.
          To adress this, wording for the most things was altered.</p>
        <p>To match the system and the real world, emojis were included next to the buttons.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>User Control and Freedom</h3>
        <p>Users are able to have a lot of freedom on how they use their app. The things they can now edit include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Texts they sent
          </li>
          <li>Username</li>
          <li>Display name</li>
          <li>Who they want to text either throgh ActorID or through username</li>
          <!-- <li></li> -->
        </ul>
        <!-- <p>Through the completion of Studio 10's assignment, it was possible to</p> -->
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Consistency and Standards</h3>

        <p>There was a lot of CSS added in order to make the buttons and feedback consistent throughout the app. These
          changes included:
        <ul>
          <li>making the "edit username" and "edit name" buttons the same</li>
          <li>making the public forum or direct message the same.</li>
          <li>making the "send" button stand out</li>
          <li>ensuring all the buttons give constant feedback, especially when being hovered over.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Error Prevention</h3>
        <p>There are many ways in which the user can make mistakes. Although these errors already had some sort of
          feedback, there were changes implemeted to optimize Error Prevention. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>getting alerts when:
            <ul>
              <li>
                username is changed
              </li>
              <li>
                name is changed
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

        </ul>

      </li>
      <!-- <li>
        <h3>Recognition rather than recall</h3>
        <p>There are many ways in which the user can make mistakes. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Typing in the wrong username</li>
          <li>Typing in the wrong ActorID</li>
          <li>Typing in the wrong channel name</li>
          <li>Typing in the wrong message</li>
          <li>Typing in the wrong name</li>
          <li>Typing in the wrong username</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These errors are prevented by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Having a "send" button that is disabled until the user types in a message</li>
          <li>Having a "send" button that is disabled until the user types in a username</li>
          <li>Having a "send" button that is disabled until the user types in a channel name</li>
          <li>Having a "send" button that is disabled until the user types in a ActorID</li>
          <li>Having a "send" button that is disabled until the user types in a name</li>
          <li>Having a "send" button that is disabled until the user types in a username</li>
        </ul>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Flexibility and efficiency of use</h3>
        <p>There are many ways in which the user can make mistakes. These include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Typing in the wrong username</li>
          <li>Typing in the wrong ActorID</li>
          <li>Typing in the wrong channel name</li>
          <li>Typing in the wrong message</li>
          <li>Typing in the wrong name</li>
          <li>Typing in the wrong username</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These errors are prevented by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Having a "send" button that is disabled until the user types in a message</li>
          <li>Having a "send" button that is disabled until the user types in a username</li>
          <li>Having a "send" button that is disabled until the user types in a channel name</li>
          <li>Having a "send" button that is disabled until the user types in a ActorID</li>
          <li>Having a "send" button that is disabled until the user types in a name</li>
          <li>Having a "send" button that is disabled until the user types in a username</li>
        </ul>
      </li> -->
      <li>
        <h3>Aesthetic and minimalist design</h3>
        <p>There was a lot of CSS added to all features to make this appear more like a texting app. </p>

      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h1>Future Directions:</h1>
    <p>There was a limited amount of time and restraints in terms of the assignment and thus the following things
      weren't altered but still fail heuristic design principles. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Visibility of system status</h3>
        <p>There is no indication of whether or not the user is connected to the server. There is also no indication of
          whether or not the user is typing. There is no indication of whether or not the user is connected to the
          server. This problem will not be adressed in this excercise since new features aren't allowed.</p>
